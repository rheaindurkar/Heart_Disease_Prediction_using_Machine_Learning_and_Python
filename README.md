Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.

The project involves analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. A variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python is used, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient.
